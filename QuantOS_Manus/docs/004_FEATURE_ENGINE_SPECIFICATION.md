## 1. Objective

The Feature Engine transforms canonical market data into a small, deterministic feature vector for the single V1 strategy.

The target is 10–15 production features.
The hard maximum is 20.

## 2. Feature Principles

Every feature must:

1. have a clear purpose;
2. be computable using information available at the decision time;
3. be deterministic;
4. be testable;
5. be reproducible from stored data;
6. provide measurable incremental value.

Features must be removed when they are redundant, unstable, or unsupported by validation.

## 3. Approved Feature Families

The initial feature set should remain small and cover distinct information:

- short-term returns;
- medium-term returns;
- volatility;
- trend strength;
- moving-average relationship;
- momentum;
- volume behavior;
- range/price structure;
- relative position within recent range;
- regime/context state.

A feature family may contribute more than one feature only when validation demonstrates incremental value.

## 4. Avoiding Feature Overlap

Do not create large collections of correlated indicators merely because they are available.

For candidate features, evaluate:

- correlation/redundancy;
- stability across time;
- incremental out-of-sample value;
- sensitivity to parameter changes;
- importance stability.

The objective is a compact information set, not the highest feature count.

## 5. Causality

A feature at timestamp `t` may use:

- current completed candle information;
- prior candles;
- approved higher-timeframe information whose close was already available.

It may not use:

- future candles;
- future labels;
- future aggregate values;
- test-period statistics;
- information created after the decision timestamp.

## 6. Higher Timeframes

Higher-timeframe context is permitted only when it is temporally aligned without leakage.

For example, a 5-minute or higher context value may be used only after the relevant higher-timeframe candle has actually closed.

## 7. Missing Data

A feature vector with required missing values must not be passed to the production model.

The correct response is a controlled `NO_TRADE`/`HOLD` outcome, not silent imputation that changes the strategy's meaning.

## 8. Feature Versioning

Every feature specification has a version.

A trained model records the feature version it expects.

A model must not run against an incompatible feature schema.

## 9. Determinism

Given identical:

- candle data;
- timestamps;
- feature configuration;
- feature version;

the Feature Engine must produce identical outputs.

## 10. Testing

Tests must cover:

- known-value calculations;
- rolling-window boundaries;
- insufficient-history behavior;
- timestamp alignment;
- missing-data behavior;
- deterministic replay;
- higher-timeframe alignment;
- look-ahead prevention.

## 11. Production Promotion

A candidate feature enters production only when it demonstrates useful out-of-sample value without creating unacceptable instability or redundancy.

The feature budget is a complexity control, not a target to fill.
